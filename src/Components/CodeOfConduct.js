                <h1>Code of Conduct:</h1>
                    Glasgow AR/VR is an event intended for education, networking, and community.
                    To ensure it is a welcoming and friendly environment for all, attendees, speakers,
                    organisers, and volunteers at any CodeCraft meetup are required to conform to the
                    following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the
                    meetup and meetup-related social event
                
                <h2>Ground Rules</h2>
                    We want the discussion to be as interesting, useful and productive as possible.
                    Without some rules in place we risk the conversations going off topic and people
                    feeling attacked. To get the most out of the event we’d ask everyone to comply
                    with the following rules:
                    <ul>
                        <li>No arguments directed at people – only at ideas and opinions. Disagreement should be respectful.</li>
                        <li>Listen to the whole of others’ thoughts – actually listen, rather than just running over your own response in your head.</li>
                        <li>Respect the group’s time. Try to keep your comments reasonably short and to the point, so that others have a chance to respond.</li>
                        <li>Consider all comments seriously, and try to evaluate them fairly. Others’ ideas and comments may change your mind, or vice versa: it’s important to be open to that.</li>
                        <li>If someone disagrees with you then evaluate both positions, and only continue to argue for yours if you continue to believe it’s right. Our discussions are about learning, so try to be open to disagreement rather than defensive.</li>
                        <li>Everyone is responsible for following the ground rules, and should help uphold them where they feel able to do so. The organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h2>Harassment Free Meetup</h2>
                    Glasgow AR/VR is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for
                    everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
                    disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate
                    harassment of conference participants in any form. Conference participants violating
                    these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference [without a refund] at the
                    discretion of the conference organizers.

                    Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender,
                    gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
                    body size, race, age, religion.</li>
                        <li>Sexual images in public spaces</li>
                        <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following</li>
                        <li>Harassing photography or recording</li>
                        <li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events</li>
                        <li>Inappropriate physical contact</li>
                        <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
                        <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour</li>
                    </ul>
            
                <h2>Enforcement</h2>
            
                    Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
                    If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right
                    to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants.
                    This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup [with no refund].
                    Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear
                    impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.
                    We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related
                    social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!
                <h2>Reporting</h2>
                    If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it
                    as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the
                    value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People
                    like you make our event a better place.
